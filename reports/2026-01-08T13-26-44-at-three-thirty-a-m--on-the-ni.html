telepath in the Sol System fell off the map in the offices of
Runciter Associates in New York City. That started vid-
phones ringing. The Runciter organization had lost track of
too many of Hollis’ PSIs during the last two months; this
added disappearance wouldn’t do.
“Mr. Runciter? Sorry to bother you.” The technician in
charge of the night shift at the map room coughed nervously
as the massive, sloppy head of Glen Runciter swam up to fill
the vidscreen. “We got this news from one of our inertials.
Let me look.” He fiddled with a disarranged stack of tapes
from the recorder which monitored incoming messages. “Our
Miss Dorn reported it; as you may recall she had followed
him to Green River, Utah, where-”
Sleepily, Runciter grated, “Who? I can’t keep in mind at
all times which inertials are following what teep or precog.”
With his hand he smoothed down his ruffled gray mass of
wirelike hair. “Skip the rest and tell me which of Hollis’
people is missing now.”
“S. Dole Melipone,” the technician said.
“What? Melipone’s gone? You kid me.”
“I not kid you,” the technician assured him. “Edie Dorn
and two other inertials followed him to a motel named the
Bonds of Erotic Polymorphic Experience, a sixty-unit sub-
surface structure catering to businessmen and their hookers
who don’t want to be entertained. Edie and her colleagues
didn’t think he was active, but just to be on the safe side we
had one of our own telepaths, Mr. G. G. Ashwood, go in and
read him. Ashwood found a scramble pattern surrounding
Melipone’s mind, so he couldn’t do anything; he therefore
went back to Topeka, Kansas, where he’s currently scouting
a new possibility.”
Runciter, more awake now, had lit a cigarette; chin in
hand, he sat propped up somberly, smoke drifting across the
scanner of his end of the bichannel circuit. “You’re sure the
teep was Melipone? Nobody seems to know what he looks
like; he must use a different physiognomic template every
month. What about his field?”
“We asked Joe Chip to go in there and run tests on the
magnitude and minitude of the field being generated there
at the Bonds of Erotic Polymorphic Experience Motel. Chip
says it registered, at its height, 68.2 blr units of telepathic
aura, which only Melipone, among all the known telepaths,
can produce.” The technician finished, “So that’s where we
stuck Melipone’s identflag on the map. And now he - it - is
gone.”
“Did you look on the floor? Behind the map?”
“It’s gone electronically. The man it represents is no
longer on Earth or, as far as we can make out, on a colony
world either.”
Runciter said, “I’ll consult my dead wife.”
“It’s the middle of the night. The moratoriums are closed
now.”
“Not in Switzerland,” Runciter said, with a grimacing
smile, as if some repellent midnight fluid had crept up into
his aged throat. “Goodeve.” Runciter hung up.
As owner of the Beloved Brethren Moratorium, Herbert
Schoenheit von Vogelsang, of course, perpetually came to
work before his employees. At this moment, with the chilly,
echoing building just beginning to stir, a worried-looking
clerical individual with nearly opaque glasses and wearing a
tabby-fur blazer and pointed yellow shoes waited at the
reception counter, a claim-check stub in his hand. Obviously,
he had shown up to holiday-greet a relative. Resurrection
Day - the holiday on which the half-lifers were publicly
honored - lay just around the corner; the rush would soon
be beginning.
“Yes, sir,” Herbert said to him with an affable smile. “I’ll
take your stub personally.”
“It’s an elderly lady,” the customer said. “About eighty,
very small and wizened. My grandmother.”
“Twill only be a moment.” Herbert made his way back to
the cold-pac bins to search out number 3054039-B.
When he located the correct party he scrutinized the
lading report attached. It gave only fifteen days of half-life
remaining.

  "prompt1": "Generate a 16-second video of Scene 1. The camera is locked on a static cinematic frame. A ticking clock is centered in frame, with a faint New York City skyline visible in the background at 3:30 A.M. The clock's ticking grows louder and more insistent. The scene slowly zooms out to reveal a dimly lit Runciter Associates office, empty except for Runciter slumped over his desk. Distant city sounds (car horns, sirens, and whispers) fill the audio, accompanied by the clock's ticking. As the scene reaches its midpoint, the distant sounds fade into an eerie silence, punctuated by the clock's steady beat, and Runciter's labored breathing.",

The camera pans across the empty space, revealing scattered papers and broken glass. A faint hum of fluorescent lights fills the audio, accompanied by the creaking of old wooden floorboards and distant city sounds muffled by the window panes.

A faint whispery voice (perhaps a phone call, perhaps a hallucination) crackles through the audio, echoing off the office walls. The voice grows louder and more urgent, but no words are discernible. Runciter's breathing quickens, his body tense and ready to spring into action.",
  "prompt4": "Create a 40-second video of Scene 4. The camera remains locked on the static cinematic frame, now framing Runciter as he stands, frozen in a moment of decision. The audio drops to complete silence, except for the faint hum of the office's electrical system. The city sounds outside have stopped, as if the very world is holding its breath. Runciter's face is a mask of determination, his eyes locked on some unseen point. The camera lingers on his face, then slowly zooms out to reveal the empty office, now bathed in a faint, eerie glow."
