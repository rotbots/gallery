<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Here's a summary in 9 sentences focusing on the DRAMATIC, VISUAL, and MEME-WORTHY aspects of Latin:

Imagine a language that's been spoken and written for over 2,500 years, leaving a lasting impact on the world like a giant, ancient tree. Latin's journey started in the lower Tiber area around Rome, Italy, where it eventually spread throughout the Roman Empire like a wildfire. Its dramatic evolution saw the rise and fall of empires, with Latin adapting to changing times like a chameleon. The language transformed from Old Latin to Classical Latin, then to Vulgar Latin, and finally to Late Latin, with each phase leaving behind its own unique mark. The Latin alphabet, derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets, became the basis for many modern languages. Picture a language that's been used for centuries by scholars, scientists, and leaders, including the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Latin's influence can be seen in the many words it has contributed to the English lexicon, making it a silent partner in shaping modern languages. Despite being considered a "dead language," Latin's legacy lives on in the Romance languages, like Italian, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The language's grandeur is a testament to its enduring power, making it a fascinating subject that continues to captivate linguists and historians alike.</pre>

Her overall posture is slouched with rounded, drooping shoulders. Her ears tilt back slightly rather than standing upright.. (0s-5s) Camera pans over a dimly lit, cluttered study. Hello Kitty, slumped on a couch, eyes half-closed, gazes downward. Her ears tilt back, and whiskers droop.

(5s-10s) She slowly raises her head, dark grey bow on her left ear fluttering. Camera zooms in on her face as music starts with a glitchy synth.

(10s-15s) Hello Kitty's gaze intensifies as she says something, but no words are audible. Camera transitions to a close-up of her mouth, which remains a flat line. Synths get more chaotic.

(15s-20s) Sudden camera cut to a shelf of Latin tomes, books sliding off the shelf as if blown away b</pre>

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>"No cap, Latin's been around for, like, 2,500 YEARS, leaving a legacy that's lowkey insane. It started in ancient Rome, spreading like wildfire, no way.

Scholars, leaders, and the Vatican used it for centuries, WAIT WAIT WAIT. Latin's dead, but its impact's still bussin', contributing to English, Italian, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, NO WAY.
