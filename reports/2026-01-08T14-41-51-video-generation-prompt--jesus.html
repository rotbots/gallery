Setting &amp; Atmosphere:

Bright, airy pottery studio with industrial brick building aesthetic (Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent)
Large skylights casting natural daylight across workbenches
Warm, encouraging, cozy atmosphere with wooden tables covered in clay dust
Multiple potter's wheels, kilns visible in background
Slightly desaturated color palette with earthy clay tones, warm wood, and soft natural lighting

The Sculpture Process:

Hand-built clay figure approximately 60cm tall on a wooden workbench
Terracotta or stoneware clay in warm brown/grey tones
Potter working with intense concentration, using wooden modeling tools, wire loops, and sponges
Close-up shots: fingers smoothing clay features, adding texture to robes with fork tines or stamps
Medium shots showing the full figure taking shape: simplified draped robes, peaceful facial expression, blessing hand gesture
The style should be intentionally imperfect and heartfelt rather than professional—capturing that "home potter" amateur charm
Visible tool marks, fingerprints, and handmade quality throughout

Filming Style:

Bright, documentary-style cinematography with handheld camera movement
Quick cuts between wide shots of the potter working and intimate close-ups of hands shaping clay
Overhead shots showing the sculpture from above
Natural color grading—clean, bright, slightly warm
Occasional slightly shaky handheld camera for authenticity
Time-lapse sequences showing building progress

Key Moments:

Potter stepping back to assess proportions, looking worried/hopeful
Nervous checking of the clock on the wall
Detail work on face and hands with fine tools
Gently lifting the finished greenware sculpture onto a board
Placing it carefully into the kiln
The tense moment of opening the kiln after firing
