<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Chris Marker was a visionary French artist who left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. His iconic film, La Jetée, is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece that has become a cult classic. The film's dramatic and visual elements, including its use of still images and narrative voiceover, have made it a staple of film studies and a favorite among cinephiles. The movie's post-apocalyptic themes and striking visuals have also made it a meme-worthy sensation, with its influential style being referenced and parodied countless times in popular culture. Marker's other notable films, such as A Grin Without a Cat and Sans Soleil, are equally visually stunning and thought-provoking. As a key figure in the Left Bank movement of the French New Wave, Marker was part of a revolutionary group of filmmakers that included Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda, and Jacques Demy. This collective of innovative artists pushed the boundaries of storytelling and cinematic technique, creating a new wave of dramatic and visually striking films that continue to inspire and influence filmmakers today. Marker's own unique style and perspective have made him a legendary figure in the world of cinema, with his films remaining as powerful and thought-provoking as ever. Overall, Chris Marker's dramatic, visual, and meme-worthy legacy continues to captivate audiences and inspire new generations of artists and filmmakers.</pre>

<h3>Scene 2:</h3>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a hyperrealistic Barney the Dinosaur with realistic scales, wearing a leather jacket, looking threatening. Barney smashes through a wall, surrounded by chaotic, meme-filled projections, with frantic glitchy synths and heavy bass drops syncing with his destructive movements, the hyperpop music intensifying the absurdity.</pre>

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>Okay but hear me out, Chris Marker's La Jetée is giving main character energy, it's a huge W for cinematic history. The way that still images tell a haunting story hits different, it's rent free in my brain. This is sending me, I'm deceased, the visuals are straight up Ohio coded, but I'm here for it, let him cook.</pre>
