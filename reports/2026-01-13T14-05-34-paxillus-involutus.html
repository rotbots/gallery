Camera pans down to reveal intricate details. Funny music starts with a bumpy beat and sound effects of stumbling. Visuals: close-up shots of the cap's rim and gills, with slight camera movement. Audio: forager's surprise 'whoa!' and subsequent stumbling sounds.\",\n  \"prompt2\": \"Produce a 12-second observational cinema video showcasing a Paxillus involutus fungus. Forager's silly, wide-eyed expression zooms in on the cap's rim and gills as camera spins around. Quirky, bouncy music plays with sound effects of camera spinning and forager's sounds. Visuals: comical close-ups of the gills and rim, with camera movement simulating excitement.\",\n  \"prompt3\": \"Design a 16-second video of a forager admiring a Paxillus involutus mushroom. They trip over their feet, flailing arms wildly as they try to regain balance. Music gets absurd with sound effects of flailing and a funny 'oomph!' as they hit the ground. Visuals: zoomed-out shot of the entire mushroom with a majestic backdrop, and a comical forager trying to balance.\",\n  \"prompt4\": \"Create a 20-second cinematic video of a forager sitting in front of a Paxillus involutus mushroom. They do an over-the-top, dramatic dance move with the mushroom serene in the background. Comedic music ends with the sound of silly dance moves and a final 'ta-da!' Visuals: forager's ridiculous expression and dance, with a gradual zoom out to show the mushroom's surroundings.\"\n}"
