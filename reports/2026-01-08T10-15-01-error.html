CAMERA STYLE TO USE: orbital camera movement, smooth 360 degree rotation around subject, dramatic reveal

Scene 1 (Opening Hook): A bright red alarm clock EXPLODES on screen as the words 'MISTAKE ALERT' flash in bold, neon letters. A cartoon character's face, distorted in a mix of horror and confusion, appears in the center, with their eyes wide open and mouth agape. - alarmed mood. Audio: A loud, piercing alarm sound effects, followed by a high-pitched, cartoon-style 'NOOO' scream.

Scene 2 (Build-up): Suddenly, a giant, spinning top made of playing cards TUMBLES across the screen, with the words 'TRUE OR FALSE?' scrolling rapidly above it. As it falls, the playing cards start to fly apart, with each one revealing a ridiculous, cartoonish image (e.g. a cat in a tutu, a dinosaur riding a unicorn). - surreal mood. Audio: A fast-paced, electronic music clip with a hint of chaos and confusion.

Scene 3 (Climax): A massive, fire-breathing T-Rex appears on screen, its eyes glowing red as it ROARS in frustration. The words 'ERROR 404: TRUTH NOT FOUND' flash above it, with a 'System Crash' sound effect playing in the background. As the T-Rex breathes fire, the screen starts to glitch and distort, with pixels flying everywhere. - frantic mood. Audio: A deep, rumbling roar, followed by a cacophony of crashing system sounds and distorted, glitchy effects.

Scene 4 (Conclusion): The screen goes black, with the words 'REBOOT' appearing in faint, neon lights. A cartoon character's face reappears, this time with a determined look, as they hold up a sign that reads 'TRY AGAIN?' A hopeful, uplifting melody plays in the background. - resilient mood.
