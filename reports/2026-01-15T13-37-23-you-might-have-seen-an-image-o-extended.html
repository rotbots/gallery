<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>The "Grinch knee surgery" meme has taken the internet by storm, featuring a blue-tinted, smiling Grinch with the caption "That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow." This absurd joke has become a cultural phenomenon, with its origins dating back to April 2021 when a similar meme was posted on MemeCreator.org featuring a squirrel. The meme gained traction and evolved, with various images being used, until it was solidified with the now-iconic blue Grinch by the Instagram account bluegrinchy. The meme's surreal and nonsensical nature has made it a staple of Gen Z humor, with its popularity surging recently due to its adoption by the crypto community. The official Dr. Seuss Instagram account even got in on the action, posting a version of the meme featuring Jim Carrey's Grinch. However, the meme's co-opting by crypto enthusiasts has led to its inevitable demise, with the joke becoming less funny as it's being exploited for financial gain. The meme's story is a testament to the power of internet culture, where absurdity and surrealism can become a viral sensation. Despite its fading popularity, the Grinch meme will remain a memorable example of the internet's ability to create and disseminate humorous, meme-worthy content. The meme's legacy will live on, even if the joke itself is no longer funny, as it has become a cultural reference point for the absurdity and creativity of online humor.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: Here's a direct description:

---

A blue-furred Grinch character with the same lanky, gangly body shape as the original. His fur is a vibrant electric blue or deep cyan color instead of green. Yellow eyes with red pupils remain the same. He has the characteristic long, crooked fingers and slightly hunched posture. His face features the same mischievous smirk with pointed teeth visible. Bushy eyebrows are blue to match his fur. He wears a tattered red Santa coat and hat, maintaining the classic Grinch silhouette. His chest is slightly lighter blue or cream-colored. Long, thin limbs with exaggerated joints give him that distinctive spindly appearance.

---. A distorted, flickering hospital corridor fills the screen, with the blue Grinch character smirking in the center, wearing a tattered red Santa coat. Aggressive phonk music blasts, with heavy bass drops and Memphis rap samples, accompanied by cowbell hits, creating a disorienting atmosphere. The camera zooms in on the Grinch's face, then rapidly zooms out to reveal the eerie, glitching environment, as ambient sounds of screaming and machinery malfunctioning fill the air, punctuated by the music's intense, pulsing beat.</pre>

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>"BRO WHAT, no cap, the Grinch knee surgery meme is bussin', fr fr. Lowkey surreal, it's like skibidi, but for memes. Wait, it's about knee surgery, NO WAY. Originating from Ohio, among us, it's a wild ride, but now it's fading, BRO WHAT."</pre>
