**Our eyes can frequently play tricks on us, but scientists have discovered that some artificial intelligence can fall for the same illusions. And it is changing what we know about our brains.**

When we look up at the Moon,[it seems larger when it is close to the horizon compared to when it is higher up in the sky](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/the-moon-illusion-why-does-the-moon-look-so-big-sometimes/)even though its size, and the distance between the Earth and the Moon, remains much the same during the course of a night.

Optical illusions such as these show that we don't always perceive reality the way we should. They are often considered to be mistakes made by our visual system. But illusions also reveal the[clever shortcuts](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00566/full)our brains use to[extract the most important](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00566/full)details of our surroundings.

In truth, our brains only accept a sip of the world around us – it would be too much to process every detail of our busy visual environments, so instead they pick out only the details we need.

But what happens when you give a synthetic mind – a machine vision system powered by artificial intelligence – an optical illusion? These systems excel at detail. They are designed to spot the patterns and the[blemishes we do not](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190116-the-invisible-warning-signs-that-predict-your-future-health). It is why they have been so effective at[spotting the early signs of diseases](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q7zqy1xlpo)in medical scans, for example.

Yet, some deep neural networks (DNNs) – the technology that underpins many of today's advanced AI algorithms – are susceptible to some of the same visual tricks as us humans. And it is providing new insights into how our own brains work.

"Using DNNs in illusion research allows us to simulate and analyse how the brain processes information and generates illusions," says Eiji Watanabe, an associate professor of neurophysiology at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Japan. "Conducting experimental manipulations on the human brain raises serious ethical concerns but no such restrictions apply to artificial models."

So far, there is no deep neural network that can experience all the illusions that humans do

Although there are many theories about why we perceive different optical illusions, in most cases there still isn't a decisive explanation.

Studying people who don't experience optical illusions has provided some clues. In one case, a person who lost his sight as a young child and had it restored in his 40s[was not](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1102.epdf?sharing_token=gMcf4qHc2up1ETfQj1S01tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NfdRQDVoQyUPL9AY0k411tJp7krM16v9cp4W64uFq_ZX5s78oD5R2XQFNJ8cdnANyLf1JTCG7Ga_m6V169LTo3uptADdWpgF8HI1X0UZSPFv4TbD5V3fMtO_CiRhkeyJLCLX2-dgYxt1O6OuWyI1Fqf0xinrWv0Y6sRdURgMxbx3AafXpddZ0U1Bj88YVcRdIojFoTLVC7k0DVVndMAeGAWHxtRc5rEaIKn4fFHnRqsGZJQYJssc5yfFor-1aQbZlzUiOtabOmwOVuRj8pusdH)tricked by illusions involving shapes, such as the famous[Kanizsa square](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-we-see-shapes-that-arent-really-there), where four strategically positioned circular fragments create illusory contours that evoke a square.

CAMERA STYLE TO USE: handheld documentary style, natural slight movement, authentic feel, observational cinema

Scene 1 (Opening Hook): A stunning, time-lapse sequence of the Moon rising over a serene landscape, with the illusion of it appearing larger on the horizon - calm and contemplative mood. Audio: Soft piano music, gentle wind sounds

Scene 2 (Build-up): An artist's depiction of a machine vision system using deep neural networks to analyze and recognize patterns, with intricate, swirling lines and shapes - intrigued and curious mood. Audio: A gentle hum of machinery, soft beeps and whirs

Scene 3 (Climax): A split-screen comparison of a human brain's neural network with a simulated AI network, highlighting the similarities and differences in processing optical illusions - mind-bending and thought-provoking mood. Audio: A soft, eerie whisper of 'perception is reality', followed by a brief, unsettling silence

Scene 4 (Conclusion): A dramatic, close-up shot of the Kanizsa square, with its illusory contours and shapes, as the camera zooms in and out to emphasize the boundaries between reality and perception - profound and reflective mood.

  "prompt1": "A 6-second time-lapse of the Moon rising over a serene landscape, with soft piano music and gentle wind sounds, shot in handheld documentary style with natural movement. As the Moon appears larger, the camera pans across the horizon, with the music swelling and the wind picking up pace.",
  "prompt2": "An 8-second animation of a deep neural network, with intricate lines and shapes swirling on screen, accompanied by a gentle hum of machinery and soft beeps. The camera zooms in and out, with a slight shake, as the network analyzes and recognizes patterns.",
  "prompt3": "A 10-second split-screen comparison of a human brain's neural network and a simulated AI network, with a soft, eerie whisper of 'perception is reality' and unsettling silence, shot in a darkened room with subtle camera movement. The camera pans between the two networks, highlighting similarities and differences.",
  "prompt4": "A 12-second close-up shot of the Kanizsa square, with its illusory contours and shapes, as the camera zooms in and out to emphasize boundaries between reality and perception. Soft, calming music plays, with a gentle voiceover saying 'the boundaries between reality and perception are being pushed to the limit' as the camera lingers on the image, with a slight movement to emphasize the illusory effect."
