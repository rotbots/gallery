<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Imagine a chaotic explosion of art, born from the ashes of World War I, igniting a global firestorm known as Dada. Picture Jean Arp, Marcel Duchamp, and Hannah Höch - the original rebels - defying conventions with their provocative works. In 1916, Hugo Ball's fiery 'Dada Manifesto' sparked the flames, declaring the movement's principles to the world. Dada's dark humor, absurdity, and rejection of logic danced across Europe and beyond, mesmerizing cities like Zürich, Berlin, and Paris. In the midst of chaos, Emmy Hennings and the 'Dada Cabarets' brought art to the streets, shattering social norms. The 'Dada stars' like Max Ernst and George Grosz created works that still shock and intrigue today. Their influence rippled through history, giving birth to styles like Surrealism, Pop Art, and even the avant-garde music scene. The 'Dada fire' continues to burn, fueling generations of artists and pushing the boundaries of creativity. Dada - the rebellious, unapologetic, and mesmerizing art movement that refused to be silenced.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a photorealistic red Squidward from SpongeBob, wearing a black beanie, he is smoking a cigarette, with tired bloodshot eyes, extremely detailed and realistic. A 30-second continuous scene:

The camera lingers on Squidward, panning down to reveal a trash-filled dumpster. Suddenly, Jean Arp's twisted sculptures burst forth from the dumpster, morphing into glitched, pixelated forms.

Camera cuts to Squidward, his eyes widening as Marcel Duchamp's 'Fountain' toilet appears, covered in distorted, dripping digital effects. Nearby, fragmented, pixelated images of Hannah</pre>

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>(Dramatic music plays in the background) "Yoooo, in 1916, the Dada fire went off, and it's been BLOWIN UP EVER SINCE, no cap. Hugo Ball drop the 'Dada Manifesto' and it's like, WHOA, the whole movement is like, 'Surrender to our madness, bruh.' Jean Arp, Marcel Duchamp, and Hannah Höch - they're like the OG Dada rebels, lowkey shaking the art world. 'Dada Cabarets' were turnt, with Emmy Hennings and the gang spittin' fire and shatterin' norms, BRO WHAT. Dada's dark humor and absurdity's still!</pre>
