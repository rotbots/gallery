We see the couple's happy moments (a candlelit dinner, a cozy walk in the park) rapidly cut with their fights (a slammed door, a thrown book). The montage ends with the woman standing alone in the dark, weeping, as the sound design shifts to a mournful, cello-heavy melody, accompanied by the rain outside (softly pattering on the roof).

The scene fades to black as we hear only the distant sound of the couple's unrecognizable voices whispering, 'I'm still me...I think'."</pre></div><h4>Parsed Prompts:</h4><div style="background:#0d1117;padding:10px;margin:5px;border-left:3px solid #f0883e"><strong>Prompt 1:</strong><pre>Cinematic opening with Style: melodramatic short-form breakup story with absurd consequence

Music peaks and abruptly ends.\",\n  \"prompt2\": \"The domestic interior transforms into a surreal dreamscape as an argument escalates. A slow zoom-out reveals a kitchen with shattered glasses and overturned chairs, as we cut rapidly between the couple's angry faces. The music (electronic, distorted beats) intensifies, punctuated by the sound of shattering glass and the couple's raised voices. 'You're just a monster!' the woman screams, as the man's face contorts in rage. The scene abruptly ends with a black screen and deafening silence.\",\n  \"prompt3\": \"A split-second montage of chaotic memories flash across the screen, each paired with a dissonant piano note. We see the couple's happy moments (a candlelit dinner, a cozy walk in the park) rapidly cut with their fights (a slammed door, a thrown book). The montage ends with the woman standing alone in the dark, weeping, as the sound design shifts to a mournful, cello-heavy melody, accompanied by the rain outside (softly pattering on the roof). The music resolves with a final, haunting note.\",\n  \"prompt4\": \"A sudden, inexplicable change in atmosphere. The camera lingers on a serene, snow-covered landscape outside the domestic window, as we hear the woman and man's conversation (formerly heated) turn to an absurd, detached murmur. The couple begins to transform into...something else. Their faces stretch, their bodies contort, and the soundscape shifts to disorienting, industrial machinery noise. The scene fades to black as we hear only the distant sound of the couple's unrecognizable voices whispering, 'I'm still me...I think'.\""
