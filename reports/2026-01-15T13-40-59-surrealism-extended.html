<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Surrealism is a mind-bending art movement that emerged in the aftermath of World War I, like a dream born from the ashes of chaos. It's a world where the rational and irrational collide, where the laws of physics are mere suggestions, and the subconscious reigns supreme. Imagine a realm where melting clocks, distorted objects, and bizarre creatures roam free, unfettered by the constraints of reality. The movement's leader, André Breton, envisioned a "super-reality" where the boundaries between dreams and reality are blurred, creating a truly hypnotic and thought-provoking experience. Surrealist artists pushed the limits of human imagination, crafting mesmerizing works that defy explanation and invite interpretation. Their creations are a visual feast, a kaleidoscope of colors, shapes, and textures that challenge our perceptions and spark our curiosity. From painting to photography, theatre to filmmaking, surrealism's influence is a riot of creativity, a explosion of innovation that continues to inspire and bewilder us to this day. The movement's iconic images have become ingrained in popular culture, spawning countless memes and references that continue to captivate audiences worldwide. With its unique blend of the bizarre and the beautiful, surrealism is an art movement that refuses to be forgotten, a testament to the power of human imagination to shape and distort reality.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a photorealistic red Squidward from SpongeBob, wearing a black beanie, he is smoking a cigarette, with tired bloodshot eyes, extremely detailed and realistic. A 30-second continuous scene: A photorealistic red Squidward, wearing a black beanie and smoking a cigarette, stands amidst a surreal, dreamlike environment with melting clocks and distorted objects. Lo-fi hip hop beats with vinyl crackle play throughout, with an uncanny, chill vibe. As the camera zooms out, then spins around Squidward, ambient sounds of whispering and gentle wind chimes fill the air, blending with the music. Squidward's tired, bloodshot eyes gaze upwards, surrounded by swirling colors and shapes, as the camera twirls and dives, capturing the chaotic, wholesome energy.</pre>
