<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>The avant-garde movement is like a rebellious army, storming the gates of traditional art with innovative and daring creations. These fearless artists are the advance guard, pushing the boundaries of style, form, and subject matter, leaving the establishment in their dust. With each bold stroke, they challenge the status quo, refusing to be bound by conventional norms. The result is a visual and literary explosion that is both aesthetically stunning and ideologically provocative. Imagine a world where artists are the rebels, tearing down the walls of tradition and building new, unapologetic masterpieces. The avant-garde is not just a movement, it's a revolution, and its followers are the brave warriors of creativity. Their works are like memes, spreading like wildfire and challenging the masses to think differently. As they shatter the norms, they create a new landscape of art and literature that is both dramatic and unforgettable. With each new creation, they ask: what's next, and how far can we push the boundaries of human imagination?</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a photorealistic red Squidward from SpongeBob, wearing a black beanie, he is smoking a cigarette, with tired bloodshot eyes, extremely detailed and realistic. A photorealistic red Squidward, wearing a black beanie and smoking a cigarette, stands amidst a chaotic art studio with 8-bit chiptune music, glitched and corrupted, filling the air. Camera zooms out as he exhales, revealing absurd art pieces, with ambient sounds of splattering paint and scraping metal. The soundtrack, a frenetic mix of retro game sounds, underscores the wholesome chaos. Camera spins around Squidward, capturing his tired, bloodshot eyes, as he surveys the artistic mayhem, the music swelling to a frenzied climax.</pre>
