<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Imagine a shell-shocked spectacle - 360 species of turtles, ranging from land-dwelling tortoises to majestic sea turtles that rule the ocean. These reptilian rebels sport a dramatic, bone-protecting shield, their ribs morphed into a mesmerizing mobile home. When danger lurks, their heads quickly disappear into their shells, a cryptic, cryptodiran camouflage. Meanwhile, pleurodirans proudly expose their vulnerable necks, a daring defiance in the face of predators. Some turtles prefer a tranquil life on land, while others are aquatic daredevils, gliding effortlessly through the ocean's vast expanse. In a bizarre twist, these air-breathing, egg-laying creatures defy the conventional wisdom of aquatic reptiles, their secret lives a testament to their adaptability.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a photorealistic red Squidward from SpongeBob, wearing a black beanie, he is smoking a cigarette, with tired bloodshot eyes, extremely detailed and realistic. (Scene: 30-second, chaotic underwater-land scene)

EXT. DISCARDED TOILET IN OHIO - DAY

A photorealistic red Squidward, wearing a black beanie, sits on a toilet seat, smoking a cigarette with tired bloodshot eyes. He's completely out of place amidst the 360 species of turtles, ranging from tortoises to majestic sea turtles.

The camera starts on Squidward, zooming in and out as he exhales smoke, looks around in disdain, and shakes his head. Turtles of all kinds scurry, swim, and roam in the background, sporting their bone-protecting shields and cryptodiran camouflage.

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>"No cap, y'all, turtles are straight fire, no cap. With 360 species, we're talkin' tortoises to sea turtles that slay, and they got this bussin' shell that's like a mobile home, BRO WHAT? Land or sea, they're vibin' to their own beat, but when danger lurks, they lowkey disappear into their shells, a whole skibidi of stealth. Meanwhile, pleurodirans are just like, 'I got this, predator' - talkin' bold, but also kinda vulnerable. No WAY, these creatures are the real MVPs, adaptin' to their worlds!</pre>
