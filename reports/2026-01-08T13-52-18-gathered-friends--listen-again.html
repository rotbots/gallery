The story starts on the island of Mata Nui, a tropical paradise inhabited by biomechanical humanoid creatures called Tohunga (later changed to Matoran as requested by the Maori who didn't want LEGO to use words from their language). The Matoran are divided into 6 villages:

Ga-koro, the village of water, built in the bay of the island. It consists of floating huts and is a fishing village that provides most of the island with fish. Ga-koro is led by the elder Turaga Nokama, the only female village elder.

Ta-koro, the village of fire is a large and heavily-defended fort with a large moat of lava, in the volcanic region of the island. It is led by Turaga Vakama, the elder of fire.

Le-koro, the village of air. It consists of huts built in the canopy of massive trees. Under leadership of the elder Turaga Matau, the Matoran of Le-koro tamed giant birds, the Kahu, to serve as transport.

Ko-koro, the village of ice, is located on top of a large snowy mountain chain. Turaga Nuju guards the large libraries were history is documented here. The Ko-Matoran are scholars and historians, not fighters or hunters. They have no defense except the harsh conditions of the icy mountains themselves.

Onu-Koro, the earth village, is built in a large cave in the centrum of a network of tunnels. Due to these tunnels that connect the villages, Onu-koro is the economic centre of the island, with a large market forum. They are also responsible for mining most of the metal used on the island. It is lead by Turaga Whenua.

Po-koro, the village of stone (not earth) is located in the desert and lead by Turaga Onewa. It houses the large sports stadium, the Kolhii arena. Po-matoran are the artists and sculptors of the island.

Central in Matoran religion is the Great Spirit Mata Nui, whom the island is named after. The creation story, as told by the Turaga, tells how this being came down from the heavens to give life to the Matoran but was put into a deep sleep by his evil brother, the evil spirit Makuta. Legends tell of six heroes, the Toa, who will one day arrive to save the day.

A young Ta-Matoran named Takua is the appointed chronicler of the island, a respected position. It is his responsibility to record important historical events. He happens to bear witness to a brutal attack on Ga-Koro, not enacted by other Matoran but by ocean creatures. Everything seems lost until a mysterious woman arises from the ocean and defeats the monsters. She is Gali, Toa of Water: the six Toa heroes have arrived to whoop the Makuta's ass. It is the Makuta who controls the island's animals, called Rahi by the Matoran, and orders them to attack the villages. Meanwhile, the Ta-Koronan guard captured a mysterious man in an animal trap, but the man effortlessly destroys the trap with a flaming sword. Turaga Vakama, elder of fire, arrives and recognizes the man as Tahu, Toa of fire. The Turaga elder orders Takua, the chronicler, to travel across the island and warn every village of the animal attacks that will shortly begin. Meanwhile, Vakama will try to figure out this weird vision that he keeps seeing in the flames: the arrival of a mysterious seventh Toa.

Takua's journey begins and every village has its own problems to deal with. Po-koro, the desert village, is afflicted by a plague until Takua finds the source of the plague in the lair of a giant scorpion monster. Pohatu, Toa of stone arrives and kicks the monster's ass. Le-koro, the village of air, is under attack by giant mosquitoes who kidnap villagers and makes them work as slaves in their hive. Takua makes friens with Kongu, a Kahu tamer (the giant birds). On the back of his Kahu, the two travel to the hive and get enslaved (which was not the intention). They cannot escape because the mosquito monsters are aided by Toa Lewa of air, who is mind-controlled by a magical mask infected by the Makuta. Out of the ground, Onua appears, Toa of</pre></div></div><div class="section"><h2>STEP 1 - Summarization</h2><div class="meta"><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Model</div><div class="value">llama-3.1-8b-instant</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Cost</div><div class="value">~$0.0003</div></div></div><div class="data-block input-block"><h4 style="color:#f0883e">INPUT PROMPT:</h4><pre>Summarize the following content in 2-3 sentences.
