<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Imagine a filmmaker who defies categorization, a true Renaissance man with a flair for the dramatic. Chris Marker, a French visionary, left an indelible mark on the world of cinema with his groundbreaking films. His iconic masterpiece, La Jetée, is a visually stunning work of art that has become a cult classic. The film's eerie black-and-white stills and haunting narrative have inspired countless memes and references in popular culture. Marker's association with the French New Wave movement is the stuff of legend, with fellow visionaries like Alain Resnais and Agnès Varda pushing the boundaries of storytelling. The Left Bank subset, where Marker found his tribe, was a hotbed of creative genius, spawning some of the most innovative films of the 1960s. Marker's influence can be seen in everything from sci-fi blockbusters to avant-garde music videos, a testament to his bold and unapologetic style. With his camera, Marker captured the essence of the human experience, creating a visual language that continues to inspire and influence artists to this day. His films are a treasure trove of dramatic, visual, and meme-worthy moments, waiting to be discovered and reinterpreted by new generations of fans.</pre>

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>Okay but hear me out, Chris Marker is giving main character energy! His film La Jetée is a huge W, it slayed that and it's still sending me. The way that he captured the human experience is rent free, I'm lowkey obsessed. This is wholesome, STOP, his films are a treasure trove of dramatic moments, and I'm literally crying, my heart cannot handle this, let him cook, he ate and left no crumbs!</pre>
