CAMERA STYLE TO USE: extremely brainrot, fast cuts, flickering motion, but high quality video

Scene 1 (Opening Hook): A tiny, multi-toed creature bursts onto the screen, doing a backflip off a trampoline while being chased by a swarm of dinosaurs. The creature has a party hat on and a 'Wanna be a HORSE' sign above its head. Suddenly, a 10-foot dinosaur crashes into the trampoline. - Epic/Surprise mood. Audio: Dramatic music with a faint 'whooshing' sound effect and a dinosaur roar in the background.

Scene 2 (Build-up): Cut to a series of absurd evolutionary transformations: the creature grows legs made of springs, then develops a unicorn horn, then gets a mustache that looks suspiciously like a caterpillar, and finally, its toes merge into a single hoof that can tap dance with lightning speed. The background transforms into a time-lapse of deserts, forests, and mountains morphing into one another. - Whimsical/Zany mood. Audio: A mix of silly music, cartoon sound effects (e.g. a whoopee cushion), and a rapid-fire narration of 'Evolution in Progress!'

Scene 3 (Climax): Cut to ancient Central Asia where humans and horses are having a rave party. Horses with neon lights on their legs and humans with glow sticks are dancing on a giant horse-shaped dance floor. The humans start yelling 'WE Domesticated YOU!' at the top of their lungs, and the horses respond with a synchronized galloping dance move that sends the partygoers into a frenzy. - Electric/Excitement mood. Audio: An upbeat electronic dance track with a pounding beat and the sound of people cheering and party horns.

Scene 4 (Conclusion): The camera pans out to reveal a majestic horse, its coat shining with a rainbow glow, surrounded by a million tiny creatures that spell out 'I LOVE HORSES!' while doing a conga line. In the background, a giant clock counts up to 4000 BCE, and the words 'Horses 4Ever' appear on screen in glittering gold letters. - Joyful/Celebratory mood. Audio: A heartwarming orchestral piece with a gentle melody and the sound of confetti popping and cheering crowds in the background.
