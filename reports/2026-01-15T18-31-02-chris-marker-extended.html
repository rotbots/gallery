His iconic film, La Jetée, is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece that has become a cultural touchstone. The movie's dramatic and eerie black-and-white still images have been endlessly meme-ified and referenced in popular culture. Marker's association with the French New Wave movement of the 1960s is a testament to his innovative and avant-garde style. The Left Bank subset, which included other legendary filmmakers like Alain Resnais and Agnès Varda, was a hotbed of creative experimentation and visual innovation. Marker's films, such as A Grin Without a Cat and Sans Soleil, are known for their dreamlike quality and philosophical depth. These movies are like visual puzzles, full of cryptic symbols and haunting imagery that beg to be deciphered and shared on social media. Overall, Chris Marker's cinematic legacy is a treasure trove of dramatic, visual, and meme-worthy moments that continue to inspire and influence artists to this day. With his unique blend of poetry, politics, and visual experimentation, Marker has become a cult hero among film enthusiasts and aficionados of the weird and wonderful.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompts</h2>
<h3>Scene 1:</h3>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a photorealistic Buzz Lightyear who has seen too much, thousand-yard stare, wearing a bathrobe, holding coffee. Buzz Lightyear in a bathrobe, holding coffee, stares into the distance with a thousand-yard stare, as 8-bit chiptune music with corrupted glitches plays in the background, camera slowly zooms in on his face, then cuts to a montage of eerie black-and-white images, with creepy glitches and horror memes flashing by.</pre>
<h3>Scene 2:</h3>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: a photorealistic Buzz Lightyear who has seen too much, thousand-yard stare, wearing a bathrobe, holding coffee. Buzz Lightyear walks through a liminal space filled with uncanny valley objects, 8-bit chiptune music distorted and corrupted, camera follows him with an unsteady hand, as he approaches a door with a sign that reads nothing, the music reaches a frantic pace, and the camera spins around him, capturing the deeply unsettling atmosphere.</pre>

La Jetée is lowkey a masterpiece, but it's straight up Ohio coded, the way it haunts me, I cant unsee this.
