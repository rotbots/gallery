Creative agency in the AI landscape

_This talk was given on October 14, 2025 at [Kinference](https://kinference.com/) in Brooklyn, New York._

I am so tired of hearing about AI. Unfortunately, this is a talk about AI.

I’m trying to figure out how to use generative AI as a designer without feeling like shit. I am fascinated with what it can do, impressed and repulsed by what it makes, and distrustful of its owners. I am deeply ambivalent about it all. The believers demand devotion, the critics demand abstinence, and to see AI as just another technology is to be a heretic twice over.

Today, I’d like to try to open things up a bit. I want to frame the technology more like an instrument, and get away from GenAI as an intelligence, an ideology, a tool, a crutch, or a weapon. I find the _instrument_ framing more appealing as a person who has spent decades honing a set of skills. I want a way of working that relies on my capabilities and discernment rather than something so amorphous and transient as taste. (If taste exists in technology, it needs to be smuggled in.)

Thinking of AI as an instrument recenters the focus on practice. Instruments require a performance that relies on technique—the horn makes the sound, but how and what you blow into it matters; the drum machine keeps time and plays the samples, but what you sample and how you swing on top of it becomes your signature.

In other words, instruments can surprise you with what they offer, but they are not automatic. In the end, they require a touch. You use a tool, but you _play_ an instrument. It’s a more expansive way of doing, and the doing of it all is important, because that’s where you develop the instincts for excellence. There is no purpose to better machines if they do not also produce better humans.

I believe artists have more helpful things to say than the money guys about how to use and creatively misuse technology. So today, I want to share four artists, and I hope you’ll leave with some more flexibility in how to collaborate with the machine in your own work, creative or otherwise.

First, some background. Over the summer, the vibe around AI seemed to shift.

All those aggressive predictions about the destruction of knowledge work didn’t hit their six-month deadline. The much anticipated GPT-5 felt more like an incremental step up from GPT-4, signaling LLMs have probably moved past the revolution phase and into optimization and evaluating trade-offs. The fact that OpenAI is encouraging everyone to fantasize about hardware with the Jony Ive annoucement tells me the software side may not have enough headroom for the profits they need. Meanwhile, small, local models are good enough for a surprising number of use cases, while being cheaper, more private, and energy efficient.

Progress has slowed, projections are being walked back, and the science is starting to look more hazy. We may not be in AI winter, but I am hoping for an AI autumn. Autumn is amazing; the air cools, the mania of summer dissipates, things slow down. Right now, the changes in AI feel incremental enough to start laying down strategy. This means we can think about our approach with steadier footing instead of vacillating in response to the hype, whether it comes from the top as LinkedIn posts by prepper CEOs or from the bottom by the hustleheads on X.

The hype is expected—new tech runs on speculation. You can feel the residue of the last 30 years</pre></div></div><div class="section"><h2>Step 1: Summarization</h2><div class="meta"><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Model</div><div class="value">llama-3.1-8b-instant</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Cost</div><div class="value">~$0.0005</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Time</div><div class="value">0.34s</div></div></div><div class="data-block input-block"><h4 style="color:#ffaa00">Input Prompt:</h4><pre>Summarize the following content in 5-6 sentences.

Frank Chimero takes the stage at Kinference in Brooklyn, New York, to share his thoughts on the rapidly evolving landscape of AI. He begins by questioning the notion of AI as a revolutionary technology, instead framing it as an instrument that requires skill and technique to wield effectively. The image of John Coltrane and J Dilla, two musical innovators, appears on screen, highlighting the importance of human touch in creative expression. Chimero believes that artists, not corporate leaders, have valuable insights on harnessing AI's potential, and he shares four artist examples to illustrate this point. As he speaks, the audience is transported to a hypothetical AI "autumn," where the frenzy of innovation has subsided, and a more measured approach to technology can be taken. The talk concludes with a powerful message about the importance of human ingenuity and creative collaboration in the age of AI.</pre></div><div class="data-block config-block"><h4 style="color:#888">Full API Response:</h4><pre>{
