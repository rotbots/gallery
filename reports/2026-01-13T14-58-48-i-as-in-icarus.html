I as in Icarus (French: I... comme Icare) is a 1979 French thriller film directed by Henri Verneuil. The title refers to Icarus, a Greek mythological figure.

    Yves Montand as Henri Volney
    Michel Etcheverry as Frédéric Heiniger
    Roger Planchon as Prof. David Naggara

    Jacques Denis as Despaul
    Georges Staquet as Le gardien de l'immeuble d'assassinat
    Brigitte Lahaie as Ursula Hoffman

The film's plot is based on the Kennedy assassination and subsequent investigation. The film begins with the assassination of President Marc Jarry, who is about to be inaugurated for a second six-year term of office. Henri Volney, state attorney and member of the commission charged with investigating the assassination (based on the Warren Commission) refuses to agree to the commission's final findings. According to the commission's rules, the member who refuses to go along with the conclusion of the investigation is tasked with re-investigating the assassination. Volney and his staff subsequently find many discrepancies in the official story, eventually uncovering a conspiracy between organized crime and the country's intelligence agency to assassinate president Jarry.

The action takes place in a fictional Western state where the spoken language is mainly French, but German, English and Spanish also are spoken. Its location, or even continent, is unknown. The capital city is made only of modern buildings, like Brasília. The political regime is presidential, the President being Marc Jarry at the beginning of the film.

The new town of Cergy in the northwestern suburbs of Paris was used as a filming location for the movie. The EDF-GDF tower designed by architect Renzo Moro is the building from which the shots were fired to assassinate president Marc Jarry. The governor's palace was the prefecture of the Val d'Oise. The huge room used for council meetings is the High Court of Justice. The long scene of the psychological experiment towards the end of the film, supposed to take place at the University of Laye, in fact takes place at ESSEC Business School in Cergy. This fictional Laye University is Yale University and the experiment shown in the film is the famous Milgram experiment, Stanley Milgram being a professor at Yale University. The filmmakers chose the modern and innovative architecture of the new town to avoid depicting any particular country.[1]

The film was awarded the Grand prix du cinéma français for Best French Movie in 1979. It received five César Award nominations in 1980, including Best Movie, Best Actor (Yves Montand), Best Screenplay, Dialogue or Adaptation, Best Music and Best Production Design.

"Imagine a thrilling cat-and-mouse game unfolding in a futuristic city, where secrets are hidden behind sleek skyscrapers and modern architecture. In 'I... comme Icare' (1979), a state attorney, Henri Volney, played by Yves Montand, uncovers a conspiracy behind the assassination of President Marc Jarry. As Volney delves deeper, he navigates a complex web of lies and deceit, leading to a heart-pumping climax. The film's gritty visuals and atmospheric score by Ennio Morricone will keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Shot on location in the modern town of Cergy, the film's use of high-tech architecture creates a sense of unease and foreboding. Will Volney be able to expose the truth before it's too late?"

The camera pans across the sleek skyscrapers as the sun dips below the horizon. - foreboding mood. Audio: Ennio Morricone's atmospheric score begins with a haunting piano melody, accompanied by the distant hum of the city.\n\nScene 2 (Build-up): Close-up of Henri Volney's face as he studies a document, his eyes narrowing in determination. Quick cuts of him walking through a crowded city street, with people blurred in the background. - intensity mood. Audio: The piano melody intensifies, with added strings and percussion, as Volney's investigative journey begins.\n\nScene 3 (Climax): Montage sequence: rapid cuts of key evidence (documents, photographs, recordings) with a pulsing score by Ennio Morricone. The images are disjointed and fragmented, like Volney's fractured understanding of the conspiracy. - urgency mood. Audio: The music escalates, with pounding drums and soaring strings, as Volney's discoveries reveal a complex web of deceit.\n\nScene 4 (Conclusion): Final showdown: Henri Volney confronts the conspirators in a dimly lit, smoke-filled room. The camera spins and swirls around Volney as he delivers a passionate speech, with the conspirators closing in. The score reaches a frenetic pace, with distorted guitars and pulsating synths. - tense mood. Audio: The music culminates in a crescendo, as Volney's determination and the conspirators' desperation collide in a heart-pumping climax.\n\nRespond in JSON format with prompt1, prompt2, prompt3, prompt4.</pre></div><div class="data-block output-block"><h4 style="color:#4CAF50">Raw LLM Output:</h4><pre>{
