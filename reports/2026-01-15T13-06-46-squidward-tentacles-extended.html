<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>In the colorful underwater world of Bikini Bottom, a grumpy octopus-like mastermind lurks, ready to unleash his wrath. Squidward Tentacles, the lovably miserable neighbor to SpongeBob, first splashed onto our screens in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. This iconic character was brought to life by the genius of marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. Voiced by the hilarious Rodger Bumpass, Squidward's disdain for all things optimistic is a spectacle for the eyes. His tentacles wave in frustration as he's constantly dragged into SpongeBob's antics. The dramatic flair of Squidward's face contortions has become a meme-worthy treasure. A treasure trove of comedic gold, Squidward's reactions can make even the grumpiest of grumps crack a smile. His existence is a beautiful disaster, and we can't look away. The master of eye-rolling, Squidward is a true Bikini Bottom legend.</pre>
