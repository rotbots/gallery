A cartoon 'Ka-CHING!' sound effect plays as the snake disappears, replaced by a shower of virtual cash and confetti.\n\nScene 3 (Climax): A single player, now a giant, muscular, and impossibly buff, comes into focus. They're flexing their darts-throwing arm, and the camera is in slow-motion, capturing every detail. The player's face is a mixture of concentration and pure, unadulterated CHAOS. - BUILD-UP TO CHAOS mood. Audio: The music reaches a fever pitch, with a deep, ominous voiceover declaring, 'The moment of truth has arrived!' Suddenly, the player's eyes bug out, and their body starts to distort, like rubber being stretched to its breaking point. The screen goes dark, and the words 'IT'S HAPPENING NOW' appear in bold, flashing letters.\n\nScene 4 (Conclusion): The final scene is a montage of darts flying, players screaming, and fans going wild. The camera is a blur of color, with flashing lights and pyrotechnics exploding in every direction. The screen fades to black, and the words 'WATCH THE PDC WORLD DARTS CHAMPIONSHIP NOW!' appear, along with a call-to-action to subscribe to the PDC YouTube channel. - ELECTRIFYING, JAW-DROPPING, MIND-BLOWING mood. Audio: The music reaches its crescendo, with a final, ear-piercing ' KA-BOOM!' sound effect. The sound of cheering fans and applause continues to echo long after the screen fades to black, leaving the viewer breathless and begging for more.\n\nRespond in JSON format with prompt1, prompt2, prompt3, prompt4.</pre></div><div class="data-block output-block"><h4 style="color:#4CAF50">Raw LLM Output:</h4><pre>{
