A person entering SCP-3008 through the main entrance and then passing out of sight of the doors will find themselves translocated to SCP-3008-1. This displacement will typically go unnoticed as no change will occur from the perspective of the victim; they will generally not become aware until they try to return to the entrance.

SCP-3008-1 is a space resembling the inside of an IKEA furniture store, extending far beyond the limits of what could physically be contained within the dimensions of the retail unit. Current measurements indicate an area of at least 10km2 with no visible external terminators detected in any direction. Inconclusive results from the use of laser rangefinders has led to the speculation that the space may be infinite.

SCP-3008-1 is inhabited by an unknown number of civilians trapped within prior to containment. Gathered data suggests they have formed a rudimentary civilisation within SCP-3008-1, including the construction of settlements and fortifications for the purpose of defending against SCP-3008-2.

SCP-3008-2 are humanoid entities that exist within SCP-3008-1. While superficially resembling humans they possess exaggerated and inconsistent bodily proportions, often described as being too short or too tall. They possess no facial features and in all observed cases wear a yellow shirt and blue trousers consistent with the IKEA employee uniform.

SCP-3008-1 has a rudimentary day-night cycle, determined by the overhead lighting within the space activating and deactivating at times consistent with the opening and closing times of the original retail store. During the "night" instances of SCP-3008-2 will become violent towards all other lifeforms within SCP-3008-1. During these bouts of violence they have been heard to vocalise phrases in English that are typically variations of "The store is now closed, please exit the building". Once "day" begins SCP-3008-2 instances immediately become passive and begin moving throughout SCP-3008-1 seemingly at random. They are unresponsive to questioning or other verbal cues in this state, though will react violently if attacked.

SCP-3008-1 is known to have one or more exits located within, though these exits do not appear to have a fixed position, making it difficult to leave SCP-3008-1 once inside. Using any other door besides the main entrance to enter the structure or breaking through the walls of the retail unit leads into the non-anomalous interior of the original store.

Since containment began 14 individuals have managed to exit SCP-3008. Following extensive debriefing all individuals have been administered amnestics and released.

Incident 3008-1: At 00:37 on ██/██/200█ a human male exited SCP-3008, followed 10 seconds later by an instance of SCP-3008-2. SCP-3008-2 caught and killed the man before itself being terminated by armed response personnel. This incident represents the only time an instance of SCP-3008-2 has been seen exiting SCP-3008. A full autopsy on the corpse was performed; see 3008-2 Autopsy Log for more details.

The man was carrying an IKEA-branded journal seeming to document his time in SCP-3008-1, transcribed below verbatim.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><h2>STEP 1 - Summarization</h2><div class="meta"><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Model</div><div class="value">llama-3.1-8b-instant</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Cost</div><div class="value">~$0.0003</div></div></div><div class="data-block input-block"><h4 style="color:#f0883e">INPUT PROMPT:</h4><pre>Summarize the following content in 2-3 sentences.

Intense, pulsing electronic music builds in the background (synchronized audio), with distant thunder rumbles and occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the dark clouds. Audio volume increases to 80%.\",\n  \"prompt2\": \"A sweeping handheld shot (natural movement) captures a group of people rushing down a narrow street, their footsteps and hushed conversations filling the air (Scene 2: Build-up). The music intensifies, with a mix of ominous percussion and soaring strings, as the camera weaves through the crowd. Ambient sounds: street chatter, rustling bags, and the sound of footsteps increase in volume to 70%.\",\n  \"prompt3\": \"A tight shot of a person's determined face, illuminated by a single dim spotlight (75° angle, handheld camera), as they stand in front of a city skyline at sunset (Scene 3: Climax). The dramatic music reaches a crescendo, with crashing cymbals and soaring horns filling the audio spectrum. Audio volume increases to 90%. A faint echo effect adds depth to the music.\",\n  \"prompt4\": \"A serene shot of a calm lake at dawn, with the camera slowly panning across the water's surface (smooth movement) as the sun rises above the trees (Scene 4: Conclusion). The music resolves into a peaceful ambient soundscape, with gentle piano notes and the sound of gentle lapping water. Ambient sounds: bird chirps, soft breeze, and water lapping against the shore create a soothing atmosphere. Audio volume decreases to 40%.\"\n}"
