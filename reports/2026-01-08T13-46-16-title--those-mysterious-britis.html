![Image 1: crop circles woodcut](https://www.timetravel-britain.com/articles/1photos/history/devil.gif)One late summer's day in 1678, an English farmer and a poor mower were arguing over the cost of harvesting the farmer's oat field. Incensed at the mower's proposed price, the farmer swore that the Devil himself should harvest the crop and stomped off. That night, a strange, bright glow lit up the field and, the next morning, the farmer returned to find round circles where the crop had been 'neatly mowed by the Devil, or some infernal spirit'. Each crop stalk had apparently been placed with such 'exactness that it would have taken above an age for any man to perform what he did in that one night'. The event frightened the farmer enough that he subsequently decided to abandon any attempt at harvesting the strange circle.

This description from a woodcut known as the _"Mowing Devil or 'Strange News out of Hartford-shire'"_ is now widely regarding as the first explicit report of a crop circle. Similar accounts have 'cropped up' throughout history leading credence to theories that the crop circle phenomenon is much more than a modern-day fad. In 815 A.D., the Bishop of Lyons wrote of corn flattened by 'magical storms'. While crop circles can occur in any weather, original theories on crop circle formation relate to swirling vortices of ionised air or some other type of natural process similar to ball lighting. Several scientific journals of the nineteenth-century also include references to storms and flattened circles. Another account from 1871 near Plummer's Hill, in High Wycombe, Bucks, describes two disc-shaped objects with flashing lights hovering over a site where the very next day a circle of bent, flattened grasses was discovered.

Tales of unusual light beams, even UFO's, are commonplace around crop circles. While some of these strange lights have been captured on film, perhaps more intriguing are the many oral accounts of crop circle activity from the days before airplanes or secret military technology. Between 1900 and 1910, one woman recalled having seen circles on her grandfather's land near Tilshead, Salisbury Plain. The wheat was apparently 'flattened so firmly that it could not lifted without springing back down.' Some crop circle researchers (know as 'cereologists' after the Roman goddess of agriculture, Ceres) have even wondered if the famous Salisbury Plain megalith, Stonehenge, was itself built to commemorate the spot where a crop circle once formed.

The area certainly has had its fair share of crop circles in recent years. In 1996, the 'Julia Set', a staggering 915 foot long formation with 151 circles, appeared near Stonehenge in broad daylight and within a forty-five minute period. No one had noticed a thing but when news of the miraculous crop circle broke, it attracted over ten thousand visitors within the following weeks.

So what exactly are these crop circles and why are they now such a prominent feature of the English countryside? No one really knows but enough research, however, has been carried out over the last two decades to establish these enigmatic patterns as one of the most awesomeÑand tangibleÑmysteries of our time. Crop circles, also know as agriglyphs and pictograms, have been reported in virtually every country around the globe and in all types of fields, in fact, similar, unexplained patterns have occurred in snow, ice, gravel and even Japanese rice paddies. Since the early 1980's over ten thousand crop circles have been documented with the vast majority appearing in England. The 'hot spot' of crop circle activity happens to be Wiltshire, perhaps because it is the home of ancient sacred sites and mystical monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury. During the warm summer months, researchers, enthusiasts, even the military, have gat</pre></div></div><div class="section"><h2>STEP 1 - Summarization</h2><div class="meta"><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Model</div><div class="value">llama-3.1-8b-instant</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Cost</div><div class="value">~$0.0003</div></div></div><div class="data-block input-block"><h4 style="color:#f0883e">INPUT PROMPT:</h4><pre>Summarize the following content in 2-3 sentences.

CAMERA STYLE TO USE: static cinematic frame, locked camera, film-like composition, no camera movement, professional framing

Scene 1 (Opening Hook): Aerial view of a vast English oat field with the sun shining down, then a subtle zoom in onto a single, perfectly circular crop formation. The camera pans out to reveal multiple formations. - curious mood. Audio: Soft, calming instrumental music and an occasional soft rustling sound from the wind in the oats

Scene 2 (Build-up): A close-up of one of the individual crop formations, with the camera rotating slowly around it to highlight its perfect circular shape and intricate details. - intrigued mood. Audio: Soft wind sounds and an eerie, whispery voiceover describing the formations as 'mysterious' and 'eerie'

Scene 3 (Climax): A bird's-eye view of the massive 'Julia Set' crop circle near Stonehenge, with the camera flying over the sprawling 915-foot-long formation of 151 circles. - awe-inspired mood. Audio: A sudden, dramatic increase in instrumental music, emphasizing the grandeur of the formation, followed by a brief, soft whispering of numbers '915 feet' and '151 circles'

Scene 4 (Conclusion): Aerial footage of a bustling field near Stonehenge, with thousands of people in the distance, then a zoom in on a lone person gazing up at the 'Julia Set' crop circle in wonder. - contemplative mood. Audio: A soft, fading instrumental theme, with a gentle whispering of '10,000 visitors' and a final, haunting question: 'What secrets lie beneath the surface of these mysterious crop formations?'

The scene begins with an aerial view of a vast English oat field, sunlight gently casting long shadows on the golden wheat. Soft instrumental music (piano, acoustic guitar) sets the calming tone. After 5 seconds, zoom in on a single, perfectly circular crop formation in the distance. The camera pans out to reveal multiple formations amidst the sea of oats. As the zoom out occurs, introduce soft, calming rustling sounds (wind through grains) beneath the music, creating a sense of curiosity.</pre></div><div style="background:#0d1117;padding:10px;margin:5px;border-left:3px solid #f0883e"><strong>Prompt 2:</strong><pre>Produce an 8-second video displaying a close-up of an individual crop formation. The camera rotates slowly (90° in 4 seconds) around the perfectly circular shape, highlighting intricate details and patterns. Soft wind sounds and an eerie, whispery voiceover (faint, mystical) describe the formations as 'mysterious' and 'eerie'.

The camera flies over the sprawling 915-foot-long formation of 151 circles, capturing the grandeur and complexity of the design. A sudden, dramatic increase in instrumental music (orchestral, cinematic) emphasizes the breathtaking view. Following the music swell, a soft, brief whispering of numbers '915 feet' and '151 circles' adds to the awe-inspired tone.</pre></div><div style="background:#0d1117;padding:10px;margin:5px;border-left:3px solid #f0883e"><strong>Prompt 4:</strong><pre>Create a 10-second video showcasing aerial footage of a bustling field near Stonehenge, with thousands of people visible in the distance.
