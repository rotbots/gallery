It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today, originally in North America. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE in Central Asia, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><h2>Step 1: Summarization</h2><div class="meta"><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Model</div><div class="value">llama-3.1-8b-instant</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Cost</div><div class="value">~$0.0005</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Time</div><div class="value">0.30s</div></div></div><div class="data-block input-block"><h4 style="color:#ffaa00">Input Prompt:</h4><pre></pre></div><div class="data-block output-block"><h4 style="color:#4CAF50">LLM Output:</h4><pre>Here's a 6-sentence summary with a focus on visual and dramatic aspects that would translate well to video:

(Opening shot of a majestic horse galloping across a vast, open landscape)

The horse, a majestic creature with a single hoofed foot, has evolved over 45 to 55 million years from a small, multi-toed ancestor. (Cut to an animation of Eohippus, a small, multi-toed creature, and then a horse, showcasing their transformation)

From the Americas to Central Asia, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, transforming them into the powerful animals we know today. (Cut to a shot of horses roaming freely in the wild, with a subtle transition to a domesticated stable scene)

Today, horses come in a wide range of breeds, colors, and markings, with a specialized vocabulary used to describe their anatomy, behavior, and life stages. (Cut to a montage of various horse breeds, showcasing their unique characteristics)

From feral horses living in the wild to domesticated populations thriving in stables, the horse remains an awe-inspiring and majestic creature. (Closing shot of a horse running freely in a stunning landscape)

This summary emphasizes the dramatic aspects of the horse's transformation, evolution, and domestication, making it perfect for a visually engaging video.</pre></div><div class="data-block config-block"><h4 style="color:#888">Full API Response:</h4><pre></pre></div></div><div class="section"><h2>Step 2: Storyboard</h2><div class="meta"><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Model</div><div class="value">llama-3.1-8b-instant</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Style</div><div class="value">Brainrot (exaggerated, chaotic, meme-style)</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Cost</div><div class="value">~$0.0005</div></div><div class="meta-item"><div class="label">Time</div><div class="value">0.80s</div></div></div><div class="data-block config-block"><h4 style="color:#888">Style Instructions:</h4><pre>Create an EXTREMELY exaggerated, chaotic, meme-style storyboard.
