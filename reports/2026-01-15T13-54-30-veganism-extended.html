<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Imagine a world where animal products are a thing of the past, and veganism reigns supreme. The dramatic shift to a plant-based lifestyle is a bold statement, with vegans abstaining from all animal-derived foods and products. It's a visually striking image: a fridge stocked with vibrant fruits and veggies, a closet filled with cruelty-free clothing. The philosophy of veganism is a powerful one, rejecting the idea that animals are mere commodities. It's a meme-worthy moment: a vegan proudly holding up a plate of vegan "cheese" made from plants. The vegan lifestyle is a dramatic departure from the norm, with its own unique aesthetic and attitude. As the vegan movement gains momentum, it's becoming increasingly stylish and desirable. With its bold graphics, colorful food pics, and passionate advocates, veganism is a visual and social media sensation. The striking contrast between a vegan's lifestyle and the mainstream is a dramatic and thought-provoking sight to behold.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: A green tabby cat with Garfield's body structure. His fur is bright lime green or forest green with darker green stripes across his back, sides, and tail. He has a large, round body with a prominent belly that hangs low. Short legs and small paws. His face is wide with half-closed eyes showing a lazy or bored expression. Large round nose colored darker green or black. Wide mouth with a smirk. Small triangular ears on top of his head. His chest and inner legs are a lighter shade of green or cream color. Thick striped tail that curves upward at the end. The same slouched, laid-back posture with droopy eyelids and an unimpressed facial expression. All his characteristic tabby markings remain but rendered in varying shades of green instead of orange.. A green tabby cat sits in a dimly lit, glitch-art filled room with a fridge behind him, stocked with vibrant fruits and veggies. Dramatic orchestral swells and epic cinematic score play throughout, with creepy ambiance sounds. The cat's lazy expression remains as the camera zooms out, pans, and rotates around him, showcasing his slouched posture.</pre>
