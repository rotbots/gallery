Soft wind whispers, distant morning birdsong, and a gentle fade-in of a traditional Chinese instrument (guqin) start playing as the camera moves, creating a contemplative mood.\",\n  \"prompt2\": \"A 8-second close-up of oracle bone inscriptions with Fu Hao's name, set against a warm, golden background, as firelight flickers across the ancient characters. The bronze characters glint in the firelight, and the shadows dance on the surrounding stone. Soft crackling of a small fire, with the gentle hum of a traditional Chinese instrument (pipa) play in the background, creating an intrigued mood.\",\n  \"prompt3\": \"A 8-second scene of a silhouetted figure in ceremonial robes performs rituals, smoke rising from bronze censers, amidst a warm, golden light. The figure's movements are fluid, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of incense. Soft chanting, the rise of incense smoke, and the crackling of the bronze censers create an immersive atmosphere, magnificent mood.\",\n  \"prompt4\": \"A 8-second close-up of Fu Hao's hands arranging oracle bones, preparing divination ceremonies, as the camera slowly zooms in on her fingers. The hands are steady and confident, with a deep sense of purpose. Soft whispers of a traditional Chinese instrument (guqin) play in the background, with a gentle fade-out of the sounds from scene 1, leaving the viewer with a lasting impression of Fu Hao's legacy, respectful mood.\"\n}"
