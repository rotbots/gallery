BY W. H. AUDEN
December 1938
About suffering they were never wrong,
The Old Masters: how well they understood
Its human position; how it takes place
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along

How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
For the miraculous birth, there always must be
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
On a pond at the edge of the wood:
They never forgot
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.

In Brueghel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry, 
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

The poem "Musée des Beaux Arts" by W.H. Auden describes the contrast between the chaos of human suffering and the indifference of the world around it. A dramatic image is painted of children skating on a pond, oblivious to the "dreadful martyrdom" taking place nearby. The poem then shifts to a vivid scene from Pieter Brueghel's painting "Icarus," where a boy falls from the sky and disappears into the water, but the world around him continues as if nothing has happened. The scene is set in a serene landscape, with a ploughman going about his day, the sun shining, and a ship sailing calmly on. The contrast between the drama of the fall and the tranquility of the surroundings is striking. The image of a boy plummeting to his death against a backdrop of ordinary, peaceful life is a powerful and haunting one.</pre></div><div class="data-block config-block"><h4 style="color:#888">Full API Response:</h4><pre>{
