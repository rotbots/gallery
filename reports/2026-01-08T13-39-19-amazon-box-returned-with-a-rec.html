"Return to Sender" is a political art project exposing the hidden logistics networks behind Amazon’s returns process. By tracing returned GPS-tracked packages, the project highlights the labor exploitation and environmental costs involved in corporate logistics. Participants across the U.S. are invited to return GPS devices to Amazon, mapping their journey through warehouses, repair centers, and disposal sites. This act challenges the opacity of corporate systems while fostering new solidarities between consumers and workers. Return to Sender installation at ZK/U: No Departures without Arrivals

Participants are encouraged to include personal letters of care and solidarity addressed to warehouse workers within their return packages. This small yet poignant gesture disrupts the anonymity of the returns process, reminding us of the human element in an often-invisible system.
