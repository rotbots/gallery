SUMMARY: (Opening shot of a person scrolling through their phone with a look of distraction)

Imagine a digital wasteland, where hours disappear in a haze of low-quality content. This is the world of "brain rot," where short-form entertainment and endless scrolling can be damaging to our mental health. (Cut to a montage of people glued to their screens, their faces bathed in the glow of their devices)

The term has been popularized by younger generations who have grown up with social media, but its impact is now being felt by people of all ages. (Cut to a shot of a person's phone screen filled with endless notifications and feeds)

As we dive deeper into this digital abyss, it's essential to take a step back and reassess our relationship with technology.

STYLE INSTRUCTIONS: Create an EXTREMELY exaggerated, chaotic, meme-style storyboard. Use absurd metaphors, dramatic overreactions, zoomer humor, rapid cuts, distorted visuals. Make it feel like a viral TikTok fever dream. Everything should be OVER THE TOP.
