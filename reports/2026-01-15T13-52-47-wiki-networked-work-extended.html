<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: Hello Kitty embodies friendship, kindness, and happiness, with her iconic mouthless design allowing people to project their own emotions onto her, making her a universal symbol of love and connection, linked to Japanese kawaii culture, though often misinterpreted by dark fan theories. She's officially a British girl named Kitty White, not a cat, created by Sanrio for "social communication," embodying messages of being nice to receive love and expressing oneself through actions.. Hello Kitty dances through a vibrant, chaotic art studio, surrounded by screens displaying neural networks and social media feeds, as dramatic orchestral swells and epic cinematic scores blast in the background, with ambient sounds of buzzing computers and camera shutters. The camera spins and twirls around her, capturing her interactions with artworks, including the "Copy and Toothpaste" exhibition, as she leaves a trail of wholesome memes and absurd art pieces, set to a mesmerizing soundtrack that builds in intensity, with a soaring trailer music chaos that fills the atmosphere.</pre>
