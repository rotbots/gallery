<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Get ready for a world of epic, gigantic robots that will leave you breathless. Mecha, or mechs, are the ultimate machines - giant, humanoid, and walking vehicles that will stop at nothing. Imagine a massive, metallic beast towering over cities, its steel limbs striding across the landscape with ease. These robots are not just machines, but an extension of their pilots, who guide them through battles and adventures. The term "mecha" originated from the Japanese shortening of the English word "mechanism," but it's so much more than that - it's a symbol of power, strength, and technological advancement. The visual of a giant robot stomping through a city is a meme-worthy moment waiting to happen, with its oversized limbs and fiery explosions. Mecha have become an iconic part of science fiction, inspiring countless anime, movies, and video games. With their dramatic entrances and action-packed battles, mecha are the ultimate showstoppers of the sci-fi world. Whether they're fighting aliens or other robots, mecha are the epitome of cool, and their larger-than-life presence is sure to leave a lasting impression.</pre>

<h2>Video Prompt</h2>
<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: Here's a direct description:

---

Shinji Ikari, a Japanese teenage boy around 14 years old with a slim, slight build and poor posture. He stands approximately 5'2" with narrow, slouched shoulders. His hair is dark brown or black, short and somewhat messy with uneven bangs that fall across his forehead. His face is thin with soft, youthful features—a small nose, pale skin, and dark brown eyes that often look downward or away. His expression is typically anxious, uncertain, or blank, rarely making direct eye contact. Dark circles under his eyes suggest poor sleep. He wears a white short-sleeved collared shirt with navy blue trim on the collar and sleeves, dark blue shorts or pants, and simple sneakers. His clothing often looks slightly wrinkled or ill-fitting. His hands are often fidgeting or hanging limply at his sides. His overall demeanor appears withdrawn and uncomfortable, with tense body language—hunched back, arms close to his body, and hesitant movements. His facial expressions range from nervous to detached, occasionally showing brief moments of distress or confusion. Shinji Ikari stands in a futuristic cityscape, surrounded by gigantic robot models, as hyperpop music blasts with glitchy synths and pitch-shifted vocals. The camera zooms in on his anxious face, then spins around him, showing mecha in the background. Ambient sounds of machinery and explosions fill the air, merging with the maximalist soundtrack. Shinji fidgets, looking downward, as the camera continues to circle him, capturing his uneasy demeanor. The music intensifies, with distorted beats and piercing synths, as the camera zooms out to show Shinji dwarfed by the massive robots.</pre>
