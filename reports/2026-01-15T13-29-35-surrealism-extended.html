<h2>Summary</h2>
<pre>Imagine a world where logic is turned upside down, where dreams and reality collide in a kaleidoscope of colors and twisted shapes. This is Surrealism, a movement born from the chaos of World War I. Picture a melting clock, a distorted landscape, or a figure with multiple faces - these are the eerie, dreamlike visions that define Surrealism. Led by the enigmatic André Breton, artists sought to blur the lines between reality and fantasy, creating an "absolute reality" that defies explanation. The result is a visual feast of illogical, meme-worthy masterpieces that challenge our perception of the world. In the realm of Surrealism, the rational and the irrational coexist, creating a world that is as fascinating as it is unsettling. It's a movement that has inspired generations of artists to push the boundaries of creativity and sanity. With its roots in the trauma of war, Surrealism is a testament to the power of art to express the inexpressible.</pre>

<pre>MAIN CHARACTER: Here's a more direct description:

---

A grey Hello Kitty character with a small silver nose ring piercing on the left side of her nose. Her fur is medium grey instead of white. She has a dark grey or black bow on her left ear. Her eyes are half-closed with a downward gaze, and her whiskers point slightly downward. Her mouth is a small flat line or slight frown instead of the typical neutral expression. Her overall posture is slouched with rounded, drooping shoulders. Her ears tilt back slightly rather than standing upright.. Grey Hello Kitty sits amidst a disorienting landscape, distorted clock faces melting into the background. Her slouched posture and drooping ears blend with the surroundings as she gazes downward, her eyes half-closed.

Camera pans past her, swooping over a melting Eiffel Tower and a figure with multiple faces, before circling back to Hello Kitty's silver nose ring glinting in the chaotic light.

A clock's hands spin wildly, numbers blurring together, as Hello Kitty's ears tilt back further, her whiskers sagging in sync. Sirens wail in the distance, their pitch escalating, harmonizing with the </pre>

<h2>Narrator Script</h2>
<pre>(Deep, dramatic voice) BRO WHAT, imagine a world where logic is turned upside down, fr fr. It's Surrealism, lowkey born from the chaos of World War I. Picture a melting clock, a distorted landscape, or a figure with multiple faces, NO WAY. Led by André Breton, artists skibidi-ed reality and fantasy, creating an "absolute reality" that's straight up bussin'. It's Ohio-level weird, but with roots in trauma, Surrealism's a testament to the power of art, WAIT WAIT WAIT, to express the inexpressible, G.</pre>
